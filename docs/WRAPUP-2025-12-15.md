# AIOS Daily Wrap-up — 2025-12-15

Summary of today's work and cleanup actions after multi-agent tests in VS Code.

**Scope**: Review and cleanup of cloud/background agent artifacts, assessment of PR #1 in Tecnocrat/Tecnocrat, and documentation of lessons learned.

**Status Snapshot**
- Orphan worktree `worktree-2025-12-14T20-59-29`: pruned from git and local branch deleted. Directory `c:\dev\Tecnocrat.worktrees` is locked by VS Code and pending removal.
- Local git state in `c:\dev\Tecnocrat`: clean on `main`.
- Remote branch `copilot/featpylint-remediation`: still present on origin (will be removed after PR closed).
- `.pylintrc` (aios-win) updated to v1.13 with three extracted settings.
- AINLP Bible Appendix L.9 updated with cloud agent limitations.

Commands used and recommended
- Prune and delete local worktree branch:
  - `git worktree prune`
  - `git branch -d worktree-2025-12-14T20-59-29`
- Remove orphan worktree directory (if unlocked):
  - `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "c:\dev\Tecnocrat.worktrees"`
  - If locked by VS Code, restart VS Code then re-run the remove command.
- Delete remote branch after PR closed:
  - `git push origin --delete copilot/featpylint-remediation`

Key discoveries
- Decoherence pattern: both cloud and background agents performed work inside the `Tecnocrat` profile repo rather than their intended targets (`aios-quantum`, `aios-server`).
- Agent output was largely documentation/templates rather than invasive code fixes; useful settings were extracted (3 Pylint settings) and merged into the canonical `.pylintrc`.
- VS Code worktree isolation creates artifacts that may remain locked until the editor releases handles — restart required for cleanup.

Actions performed today
- Reviewed PR #1 (Tecnocrat/Tecnocrat) and assessed low merge value (~10%); extracted three useful `.pylintrc` settings and added to `aios-win/.pylintrc` v1.13.
- Added Appendix L.9 to the AINLP Bible documenting cloud/background agent limitations and recommendations.
- Pruned worktree references and deleted local orphan branch `worktree-2025-12-14T20-59-29`.

Pending user actions
- Close PR #1 in `Tecnocrat/Tecnocrat` with rejection comment: `AINLP.orchestration[REJECT] — PR closed without merge. Agent landed in wrong repository.`
- After PR closure, delete remote branch: `git push origin --delete copilot/featpylint-remediation`.
- Restart VS Code and delete `c:\dev\Tecnocrat.worktrees` to remove remaining locked directory.

Recommended next steps
1. Close PR #1 and delete the remote branch.
2. Restart VS Code and remove the `Tecnocrat.worktrees` directory.
3. Open issues in `aios-quantum` and `aios-server` describing the required Pylint remediation work and assign to orchestrator or a cloud agent with explicit repo context.
4. Consider adding safety checks in agent dispatch logic: verify current repo matches intended target before making changes or creating worktrees.

Lessons learned
- Agents are reliable as in-repo workers but cannot be trusted to cross-navigate to other repositories. Orchestration and explicit dispatch context are required.
- Always include a clear manifest of target repo and branch when dispatching agents from a central orchestrator.

Files touched (this session)
- `aios-win/.pylintrc` — updated to v1.13 (added 3 extracted settings)
- `AIOS/docs/AINLP/AINLP_BIBLE_CORPUS.md` — Appendix L.9 added
- `AIOS/docs/WRAPUP-2025-12-15.md` — (this file)

If you'd like, I can: close PR comment drafts, open the remediation issues in the correct repos, or restart VS Code and remove the locked directory for you. What's your preference?
