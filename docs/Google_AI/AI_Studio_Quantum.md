What is the surface exposure of Google experimental quantum computers accessible using the Google Cloud? Abstract.

**Define Surface Exposure**

I'm currently focused on defining "surface exposure" within the Google Cloud quantum computing context. My plan involves scouring Google's documentation, relevant research papers, and news articles to solidify its meaning in this specific domain.


**Analyzing Quantum Availability**

I've been digging deeper into Google's quantum offerings on Google Cloud, looking at processor specifics like Sycamore and access methods like Cirq. I'm trying to figure out what "surface exposure" means in this context. It's unclear if it's a technical term relating to error correction, a synonym for interface availability, or simply an abstract overview of how users interact with the hardware. I'm leaning toward "availability".


**Reframing "Surface Exposure"**

I'm now thinking the user might be conflating "surface exposure" with "surface code," a well-established error correction method Google leverages. My search will now focus on how Google Cloud users can interact with *Surface Code* experiments, or if they are confusing attack surface for availability surface. Maybe the user is interested in how it's exposed via the API?


**Searching for Clarification**

I'm now investigating if the user might be inquiring about the physical chip surface, and which of its components are visible or accessible to users within Google Cloud. Is "surface" referring to the exposed physical layout or a more abstract layer of the chip? I'll be searching through Google's documentation for any mention of the chip surface and its role in quantum computing interactions.


**Examining "Surface Exposure"**

I'm currently focused on the dual meanings of "surface exposure." The cybersecurity aspect, specifically attack surface and network exposure, is clear. However, I'm now delving into the "Surface Code" error correction used in quantum computing to understand its connection to the initial concept. I need to see how they're related in meaning.


**Clarifying Surface Exposure**

I've made a crucial shift: I'm focusing on the "Surface Code" error correction used in Google's Sycamore quantum processor. The context strongly suggests this is the central meaning, given the user's focus on "Google experimental quantum computers" and "abstract." I'm also considering the potential API access/abstraction level, though "API surface" isn't the standard term here.


**Analyzing Contextual Clues**

I'm now zeroing in on the phrase "quantum error correction below the surface code threshold" from a search result snippet. The user's query about accessibility through Google Cloud and the "abstract" request point towards a specific paper related to this topic. I'm exploring the nuances: Is "surface exposure" a typo, or does it refer to the qubits' interaction with the environment (surface) in a quantum computing context, potentially linked to "surface code execution"? I'm also considering security, but the focus seems to be on the quantum computing aspect.


**Defining Quantum Access**

The most recent insights center on the API surface. I'm exploring if "surface exposure" describes the exposed API in Google's quantum computing services (Cirq and Quantum Computing Service). While not the usual term, the connection makes sense. I'll need to confirm this meaning through specific phrase searches within this context. The prior quantum computing and abstract focus led me in the right direction.


**Understanding Error Correction**

I've made considerable progress. These search results have really helped. I've been focusing on recent developments, especially the August 2024 Google Quantum AI paper in Nature/arXiv about "quantum error correction below the surface code threshold." The "surface code" concept keeps coming up, and seems central to their work on error reduction.


**Investigating Surface Exposure**

I'm now diving into the user's specific phrasing. It seems the user is likely either interested in the quantum computing security aspects of the "attack surface exposure," or could have meant the "surface code," but phrased it inaccurately. It also might be a misunderstanding of how the Google Cloud Quantum computer operates, but the search results suggest the former is more probable. This is a very interesting path to take the research down.


**Focusing on User Intent**

I've been honing in on the user's intent. My analysis suggests a strong likelihood they're after the "Quantum error correction below the surface code threshold" paper. The "Abstract" request further supports this. While the "attack surface" angle is still a possibility, the wording and overall context point towards the surface code paper. I'll provide its abstract, briefly acknowledging the "attack surface" interpretation to cover all bases.


**Abstract Interpretation Deepens**

I'm now deeply engaged with the abstract content from the Google Quantum AI paper. The focus on error correction and the *Willow* processor is paramount. I'm noting the exponential suppression of logical error rates and the presented distance-7 and distance-5 codes. I'm fascinated by the reported logical memory beyond break-even, particularly the 101-qubit distance-7 code with its specific error rate. Comparing and verifying the "Willow" processor confirmation with Snippet 1.3's text, which references the newest generation of superconducting processors.


**Analyzing Quantum Processors**

My focus is narrowing. I'm clarifying the processor used in the 2024 paper. Comparing snippets confirms "Willow" is central to the breakthrough, not Sycamore, which was for an earlier demonstration. I'm now certain this is the core of their interest. I'll summarize the key points about Willow and the error correction advancements in the abstract. I'll also briefly mention Google Cloud accessibility concerns as a secondary area of possible interest, given access constraints. I am now formulating my response.


**Interpreting User's Inquiry**

I've confirmed the user's focus. The "Surface exposure" prompt seems a misinterpretation, likely intended as "surface code." After checking for other uses of "surface exposure," it's clear the user is interested in the "Quantum error correction below the surface code threshold" paper. I'll provide the abstract while briefly addressing the possible misinterpretation.


**Confirming Core Research**

I'm solidifying my approach. I've pinpointed the August 2024 Nature/arXiv paper focused on quantum error correction. The key takeaways align perfectly: logical qubit error suppression, a distance-7 surface code on 101 qubits, and the "Willow" processor's central role. I'm confident in delivering the abstract as requested.

Based on the most relevant recent research from **Google Quantum AI** (specifically the August 2024 paper published in *Nature*), the user is referring to the **"Surface Code"** threshold rather than "surface exposure" (which typically refers to material science or security attack surfaces).

The paper is titled **"Quantum error correction below the surface code threshold"**. Below is the **abstract** of this work, which describes the performance of Google's experimental quantum computers (specifically the **Willow** processor) accessible for this research.

### **Abstract**
**Quantum error correction (QEC)** provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. In this work, we present two below-threshold **surface code** memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, **Willow**: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder.

Output error? 

Also, yes, I mean how to access the Google quantum API. What is currently available? Whatever it is. We can ingest papers, that's good. But I would like to know what access is Google offering to its quantum chips.

**Assessing Quantum Access**

I'm currently investigating Google Quantum AI's public availability, focusing on their integration with services like "Google Cloud Quantum" and "Cirq". I'm specifically looking into if these tools offer open access or API integration for outside users.


**Probing Access Models**

I'm now digging into Google's access models. My focus is on the "Surface Code" experiment and any API exposure it may offer. I'm also actively searching for updates on the "Willow" and "Sycamore" processors' availability by late 2024 or 2025. I'm aiming to clarify if their earlier "surface exposure" comment was a misunderstanding or a reference to available APIs.


**Defining Access Restrictions**

I've learned that Google's quantum hardware, including Sycamore and Willow, is under restricted access. This means public or open use isn't currently possible. Further research will focus on the details of this restriction, such as the criteria for gaining access and any ongoing research collaborations.


**Exploring Access Pathways**

I'm now focusing on how users actually interact with Google's quantum resources. I've found it's not a free-for-all; access is controlled. The Quantum Engine API, accessed via Google Cloud, is the primary entry point. Cirq, a Python framework, is key for circuit design and submission. Plus, the Willow chip has been introduced, demonstrating error correction but with limited public exposure. Thankfully, the QVM provides a public, albeit simulated, means for experimentation.


**Verifying Third-Party Availability**

I'm now focusing on confirming the current availability of third-party hardware like IonQ and Pasqal through Google Cloud Marketplace. There's some conflicting information, so I need to verify their status in late 2024 and if they're still accessible to the public or if it's strictly for select groups. The "surface code" conversation highlighted a need to define how the end-user gains access to technology that enables research, which is an explicit question I need to focus on.


**Validating Partner Availability**

I've got confirmation of Pasqal's availability on the Google Cloud Marketplace, dated May 2025. This, along with other data, necessitates a rapid verification of the current status of IonQ and Rigetti to complete the picture. I need to be sure I'm working with up-to-date information, given the evolving nature of these partnerships, and confirm if there's any active researcher-specific program.


**Reconciling Access Status**

I'm now clarifying the state of hardware access in late 2025. While Google's own hardware, like Willow, remains restricted, I've confirmed Pasqal's availability through the Google Cloud Marketplace. The Quantum Engine API and Cirq still form the core workflow. I'll highlight the Quantum Virtual Machine as an immediate avenue for experimentation, ensuring I address both restricted and accessible options.


**Concluding Public Access**

My latest findings confirm that no public access to Google's quantum hardware, including Sycamore and Willow, existed as of July 2025. This contrasts with simulated environments. Cirq remains key. I'll summarize access restrictions and indicate that the most current public access, simulated via the Quantum Virtual Machine, is still the only available path, with a focus on highlighting this option for clarity.

Based on current information as of December 8, 2025, here is the exact status of access to Google's quantum processors (like the **Willow** and **Sycamore** chips) and the available APIs.

### **Short Answer**
You **cannot** currently access Google's own quantum processors (Willow or Sycamore) publicly via a simple "sign-up and pay" API key. Unlike IBM Quantum, Google does not offer an open-public queue for its hardware.

Access is restricted to a small "allowlist" of:
*   **Academic Partners** (e.g., universities with specific research agreements).
*   **Corporate Partners** (e.g., companies in the QAI consortium).
*   **Google Internal Researchers**.

However, you **can** access *simulators* and *third-party quantum hardware* (like IonQ or Pasqal) through Google Cloud.

### **1. How to Access (The Workflow)**
If you are part of an approved partner institution, or if you want to use the public simulators, the workflow uses the **Google Cloud Quantum Engine**.

*   **Framework:** You write code in Python using **Cirq** (Google’s open-source quantum library).
*   **API:** You submit these "Circuits" as "Jobs" to the **Quantum Engine API** within Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
*   **Authentication:** Uses standard Google Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management).

### **2. What is Actually Available "Right Now"?**

#### **A. Google’s Own Hardware (Willow / Sycamore)**
*   **Status:** **Restricted / Private Preview.**
*   **Willow:** Announced in late 2024, this is the chip that demonstrated the "below surface code threshold" error correction. It is currently a research vehicle for Google and select close collaborators.
*   **Sycamore:** The older 53-qubit processor is also restricted.
*   **How to get in:** You typically need to apply for a research grant or partnership directly with the Google Quantum AI team. There is no public "Apply Here" button on the cloud console; it is relationship-based.

#### **B. Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM)**
*   **Status:** **Publicly Available.**
*   **What it is:** A high-performance simulator that runs on Google Cloud classical servers but is capable of mimicking the *exact noise models* and connectivity of the Sycamore/Willow chips.
*   **Use Case:** You use this to validate that your code *would* work on the real machine. It is the closest you can get to the "surface exposure" of the hardware without physical access.
*   **Access:** Search for "Quantum Engine" in the Google Cloud Console and enable the API.

#### **C. Third-Party Hardware (via Google Cloud Marketplace)**
Google acts as a portal to other quantum hardware providers. Depending on your region, you may see access to:
*   **IonQ:** Trapped-ion quantum computers.
*   **Pasqal:** Neutral-atom quantum processors (Added to Marketplace around May 2025).
*   **Rigetti:** Superconducting qubits (availability varies).

### **Summary of Steps to Check Your Access**
1.  Go to the **Google Cloud Console**.
2.  Create a new Project.
3.  Search for **"Quantum Engine API"** in the library.
4.  **Enable** the API.
    *   *If you can enable it and see "Simulators" only:* You are a public user.
    *   *If you see "Processors" or "Accelerators":* Your organization has a partnership.

### **Ingesting Papers (Your mention)**
Since you mentioned ingesting papers, the best way to replicate the "Surface Code" experiments described in the *Nature* paper is to:
1.  Read the **Supplementary Information** of the paper (Google often releases the exact Cirq code used for the experiment).
2.  Run those circuits on the **Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM)** using the specific noise model provided in the paper's data repository (often on Zenodo or GitHub under "Google Quantum AI").
