## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AIOSChatParticipant** (`chatParticipant.ts`)
   - Handles user commands and UI interaction
   - Provides user feedback and error reporting
   - Integrates with context manager for persistence

2. **AIOSContextManager** (`contextManager.ts`)
   - Manages conversation state and persistence
   - Handles workspace context capture
   - Provides context statistics and management

### Data Flow
```
User: @aios /save
    ↓
AIOSChatParticipant.handleSlashCommand()
    ↓
AIOSContextManager.saveContext()
    ↓
VSCode GlobalState.update()
    ↓
Success/Error Response to User
```

## Usage Patterns

### Recommended Workflow
1. **Daily Development**: Load context at start, save at end
2. **Debugging Sessions**: Save context before major debugging efforts
3. **Feature Development**: Save after completing logical units of work
4. **Context Management**: Use `/reset` when context becomes unwieldy

### Command Ecosystem
- `@aios /save` - Save current context
- `@aios /load` - Load saved context
- `@aios /reset` - Clear context
- `@aios /status` - Monitor context state
- `@aios /help` - Command reference

## Integration with AIOS Architecture
