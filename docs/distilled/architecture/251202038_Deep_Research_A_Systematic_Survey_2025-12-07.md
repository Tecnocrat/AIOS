## Summary
This paper presents a systematic survey of "Deep Research" (DR) systems, which leverage large language models (LLMs) combined with external tools like search engines to create research agents capable of completing complex, open-ended tasks. The survey covers a roadmap, foundational components (query planning, information acquisition, memory management, answer generation), optimization techniques (prompting, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning), and evaluation criteria for DR systems.

## Key Concepts
- **Deep Research (DR):** A paradigm combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with external tools (e.g., search engines) to enable LLMs to act as research agents.
- **Three-Stage Roadmap:** A structured approach to DR, including query planning, information acquisition, and answer generation.
- **Key Components:**
    - **Query Planning:**  Developing effective search queries to gather relevant information.
    - **Information Acquisition:**  Retrieving and processing information from external sources.
    - **Memory Management:**  Storing and organizing acquired information for later use.
    - **Answer Generation:**  Synthesizing information to produce a coherent and verifiable answer.
- **Optimization Techniques:**
    - **Prompting:**  Designing effective prompts to guide LLM behavior.
    - **Supervised Fine-Tuning:** Training LLMs on specific DR tasks.
    - **Agentic Reinforcement Learning:** Using reinforcement learning to optimize the agent's overall research strategy.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Metrics and methods for assessing the performance of DR systems.
- **Open Challenges:** Areas where further research is needed in the field of DR.

## AIOS Relevance
This research is highly relevant to AIOS architecture, particularly in the development of its cognitive and reasoning capabilities. The Deep Research paradigm offers a potential blueprint for AIOS to independently conduct research, gather information, and generate insights on a wide range of topics. The components outlined in the survey, such as query planning and memory management, align directly with the requirements for an AIOS to effectively explore and understand its environment. Furthermore, the optimization techniques described could be applied to train AIOS agents to perform complex cognitive tasks.
