## Summary
AgentBay is a novel sandbox service designed for hybrid human-AI interaction in agentic systems. It provides secure, isolated execution environments across various platforms and introduces an Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP) for seamless human intervention in AI agent tasks, offering improved performance and reduced bandwidth consumption compared to traditional remote access solutions.

## Key Concepts
- **Hybrid Interaction Sandbox:** A secure environment that allows both AI agents and human operators to interact with a system, with seamless transitions between automated and manual control.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Supervision:** Incorporating human intervention and oversight into AI agent operations to address real-world exceptions and ensure reliability in mission-critical applications.
- **Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP):** A protocol optimized for hybrid interaction, dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming to provide low-latency and resilient performance, even in weak network conditions.
- **Unified Session Control:** A session design enabling AI agents to programmatically interact with mainstream interfaces while allowing human operators to seamlessly take over full manual control at any moment.
- **Performance Improvement:** Achieving better task completion rates and reduced bandwidth consumption by incorporating the AgentBay model.

## AIOS Relevance
AgentBay provides a practical approach to addressing the limitations of current AI agents by incorporating human oversight. This aligns with the AIOS concept of creating robust and reliable AI systems. The seamless hybrid interaction mechanism is relevant to the integration of conscious oversight with autonomous functions. The framework can be leveraged to establish a robust and controllable environment for AI exploration and development, potentially preventing unforeseen consequences and allowing human intervention when the AI encounters unfamiliar situations.
