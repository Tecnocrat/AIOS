  old_path: /
  new_path: /ai/tests/test_chatgpt_integration_path.py
  date: 2025-08-11
  reason: >
    Harmonize tests under ai/tests for pytest compatibility and avoid root-level files.
  harmonization: >
    Aligns with AIOS Agentic File Creation Policy; improves discoverability and CI wiring.

  harmonization: >
    Enables Git discovery for runtime logs; unifies paths per docs/runtime_intelligence guidance.

- kind: removal
  file: test_chatgpt_integration.py
  old_path: /
  date: 2025-08-12
  reason: >
    Physical cleanup of legacy root-level test after successful relocation and harmonization under ai/tests/.
  harmonization: >
    Enforces single source of truth for ChatGPT integration path test; reduces root clutter and reinforces dev.run.md anchor semantics.

  old_path: /
  new_path: /scripts/setup_env.ps1
  date: 2025-08-12
  reason: >
    Relocate and enhance environment bootstrap script under scripts/ with drift detection, report-only mode, and governance-aligned naming.
  harmonization: >
    Eliminates root-level script clutter and centralizes operational automation; adds reproducibility via requirements hash and exit code semantics.

- kind: mitigation
  file: test_opencv_aios_integration.py (recurrence)
  old_path: /
  date: 2025-08-13
  reason: >
    Zero-byte recreation detected after prior deprecation; removed and guard script introduced.
  harmonization: >
    Added scripts/root_clutter_guard.ps1 to enforce absence of deprecated root artifacts and log future removals.

- kind: addition

  old_path: n/a
  new_path: /scripts/root_clutter_guard.ps1
  date: 2025-08-13
  reason: >
    Introduce automated guard to remove deprecated root files (initial list: test_opencv_aios_integration.py) and append removal events to log.
  harmonization: >
    Strengthens path hygiene controls and prevents silent drift from governance policies.

- kind: governance_update
  file: aios_admin.py filtering
  old_path: /runtime_intelligence/tools/aios_admin.py
  date: 2025-08-13
  reason: >
    Exclude deprecated root-level filenames from generated folder_structure.json inventories.
  harmonization: >
    Prevents legacy filenames from seeding accidental recreation events and ensures inventories reflect governed state.

- kind: addition
  file: root_clutter_guard CI workflow
  old_path: n/a
  new_path: /.github/workflows/root-clutter-guard.yml
  date: 2025-08-13
  reason: >
    Continuous enforcement of root file hygiene; fails PRs if deprecated root files reappear.
  harmonization: >
    Automates governance, reducing manual oversight for path hygiene.

- kind: addition

  harmonization: >
    Shifts hygiene enforcement left into the developer workflow.

- kind: enhancement
  file: folder_structure.json archival
  old_path: /docs/AIOS/folder_structure.json
  date: 2025-08-15
  reason: >
    Introduce automatic tachyonic archival of prior folder_structure.json snapshots before regeneration
    (PowerShell script scripts/generate_folder_structure.ps1 and Python tool runtime_intelligence/tools/aios_admin.py)
    enabling temporal diffing and rollback without polluting project root.
  harmonization: >
    Aligns with Agentic File Creation Policy by storing snapshots under docs/tachyonic_archive/folder_structure with
    timestamped filenames; supports forensic change tracking. Added pruning capability (dev terminal action) to retain
    bounded history (default 10) mitigating doc bloat.
