## Components

### 1. RobustPythonEnvironmentManager

Core environment management class that handles:
- Environment discovery across multiple sources
- Configuration persistence with backup
- Health monitoring and verification
- Environment activation and management

```python
from aios.ai.src.core.integration.robust_python_environment_manager_clean import (
    get_environment_manager
)

manager = get_environment_manager()
health_count = manager.refresh_environments()
```

### 2. AIOSPythonEnvironmentIntegration

AIOS integration layer providing:
- Context-aware environment handling
- Automatic recovery strategies
- Integration with fractal/holographic context
- OS reinstall preparation and recovery

```python
from aios.ai.src.core.integration.aios_python_environment_integration import (
    initialize_aios_python_environment
)

integration = initialize_aios_python_environment(context_manager)
health_report = integration.perform_health_check()
```

## Usage

### Basic Initialization

```python
# Initialize the environment management system
from aios.ai.src.core.integration.robust_python_environment_manager_clean import (
    initialize_python_environment_for_aios
)

manager = initialize_python_environment_for_aios()

# Get health status
health = manager.health_check()
print(f"Healthy environments: {health['healthy_environments']}")
```

### AIOS Integration

```python
# Initialize with AIOS integration
from aios.ai.src.core.integration.aios_python_environment_integration import (
    initialize_aios_python_environment
)

# Assuming you have an AIOS context manager
integration = initialize_aios_python_environment(context_manager)

# Perform health check with automatic recovery
health_report = integration.perform_health_check()
```

### Environment Discovery

```python
# Discover all Python environments
environments = manager.discover_python_installations()

for env in environments:
    print(f"Name: {env.name}")
    print(f"Path: {env.python_path}")
    print(f"Version: {env.version}")
    print(f"Virtual: {env.is_virtual}")
    print(f"Health: {env.health_status}")
```

### Setting Active Environment

```python
# List available environments
environments = manager.list_environments()
healthy_envs = [env for env in environments if env.health_status == "healthy"]

# Set active environment
if healthy_envs:
    success = manager.set_active_environment(healthy_envs[0].id)
    if success:
        print(f"Activated: {healthy_envs[0].name}")
```

## OS Reinstall Preparation

### Before Reinstall

```python
# Prepare comprehensive backup
integration = get_aios_python_integration()
backup_file = integration.prepare_for_os_reinstall()
print(f"Backup created: {backup_file}")

# The backup includes:
# - Complete environment configuration
# - Package lists
# - Virtual environment locations
# - Recovery instructions
# - Diagnostic information
```

### After Reinstall

```python
# Recover from backup
integration = AIOSPythonEnvironmentIntegration()
success = integration.post_reinstall_recovery(backup_file)

if success:
    print("Environment recovery successful")
else:
    print("Manual intervention may be required")
```

## Recovery Strategies

The system includes automatic recovery strategies for common issues:

### 1. PATH Recovery
- **Trigger**: No healthy environments found
- **Action**: Rediscover environments across all known locations
- **Fallback**: Prompt for manual Python installation

### 2. Missing Active Environment
- **Trigger**: No active environment set
- **Action**: Select best available environment (prefers virtual environments)
- **Fallback**: Use first healthy environment found

### 3. Broken Environment Cleanup
- **Trigger**: Environments marked as missing/broken
- **Action**: Create snapshots then remove broken references
- **Fallback**: Manual environment recreation

## Configuration

### VS Code Settings

The system integrates with VS Code through `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "./ai/src",
        "./ai/src/core",
        "./ai/src/core/integration"
    ],
    "aios.pythonEnvironment.autoDiscovery": true,
    "aios.pythonEnvironment.healthCheckInterval": 300,
    "aios.pythonEnvironment.autoRecovery": true,
    "aios.fractalHolographic.enabled": true,
    "aios.fractalHolographic.contextPersistence": true
}
```

### Environment Configuration

Environment data is stored in `config/python_environments.json`:

```json
{
    "env_id_1": {
        "id": "env_id_1",
        "name": "Python 3.11",
        "python_path": "C:\\Python311\\python.exe",
        "version": "3.11.0",
        "is_virtual": false,
        "virtual_env_path": null,
        "packages": ["pip==23.0", "setuptools==65.0"],
        "is_active": true,
        "last_verified": "2025-01-27T10:30:00",
        "health_status": "healthy"
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Python Environments Found
```python
# Force refresh and rediscovery
manager = get_environment_manager()
healthy_count = manager.refresh_environments()

if healthy_count == 0:
    print("No Python installations found")
    print("Please install Python and run discovery again")
```

#### Environment Path Issues
```python
# Generate diagnostic report
integration = get_aios_python_integration()
diagnostic = integration.get_diagnostic_report()

print("Environment paths:")
for env in diagnostic['health_check']['environments']:
    print(f"  {env['name']}: {env['python_path']}")
```

#### Recovery from Corruption
```python
# Use backup file if main config is corrupted
manager = RobustPythonEnvironmentManager()
# Manager automatically tries backup file if main file fails

# Or manually restore from export
backup_file = "path/to/backup.json"
imported_count = manager.import_environment_config(backup_file)
print(f"Imported {imported_count} environments")
```

### Diagnostic Commands

```python
# Comprehensive health check
health = manager.health_check()
print(f"Health report: {health}")

# Environment information
for env in manager.list_environments():
    info = manager.get_environment_info(env.id)
    print(f"Environment {env.name}: {info}")

# Full diagnostic report
diagnostic = integration.get_diagnostic_report()
print(f"Diagnostic: {diagnostic}")
```

## Integration with AIOS Context System

### Context Preservation

The environment manager integrates with AIOS's fractal/holographic context system:

```python
# Environment state is automatically preserved in context snapshots
context_manager.create_snapshot("before_environment_change")

# Change environment
manager.set_active_environment(new_env_id)

# Environment state can be restored from context
context_manager.restore_snapshot("before_environment_change")
```

### Fractal/Holographic Integration

- **Environment snapshots** are part of the holographic context
- **Recovery strategies** use fractal patterns for self-healing
- **Context preservation** maintains environment state across sessions
- **Memory management** follows holographic data structure patterns

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Environment discovery: ~10-50MB during scan
- Configuration storage: ~1-5MB persistent
- Snapshot storage: ~100KB-1MB per snapshot
- Health monitoring: ~5-10MB continuous

### Optimization Tips
1. **Limit environment scanning**: Set specific search paths
2. **Cache health checks**: Use health check intervals
3. **Cleanup old snapshots**: Regular maintenance of backup files
4. **Monitor memory usage**: Track environment manager memory footprint

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Remote environment support**: SSH-based Python environments
2. **Container integration**: Docker/Podman Python environments
3. **Cloud environment sync**: Synchronize environments across machines
4. **AI-powered recovery**: Machine learning for environment issue prediction
5. **Performance profiling**: Environment performance monitoring

### Integration Roadmap
1. **VSCode extension**: Native VSCode extension for environment management
2. **C# UI integration**: Rich UI for environment visualization
3. **AINLP compiler**: Natural language environment commands
4. **Debugging integration**: Environment-aware debugging tools

## Security Considerations

### Path Security
- Validate all discovered Python paths
- Prevent execution of arbitrary binaries
- Sanitize environment variables

### Configuration Security
- Encrypt sensitive environment data
- Secure backup file permissions
- Validate imported configurations

### Network Security
- Secure communication for remote environments
- Certificate validation for cloud sync
- Encrypted backup transmission
