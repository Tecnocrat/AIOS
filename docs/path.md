# Project Roadmap

### **Steps to Implement the Roadmap**

1. **Paste the Roadmap into** `vscopilot.md`: COMPLETE

   * Add the roadmap to the `vscopilot.md` file in the md folder for archival and reference purposes. COMPLETE

2. **Initialize the Monorepo**: COMPLETE

   * Create the following folder structure in the `AIOS` repository: COMPLETE

     ```
     /orchestrator/        # C++ core kernel  
     /director/            # C# orchestration & UI layer  
     /scripts/             # Python AI glue & ingestion  
     /docs/                # Architecture docs & sequence diagrams  
     /tests/               # Unit/integration tests  
     ```

3. **Scaffold Each Folder**: COMPLETE

   * **Orchestrator (`/orchestrator`)**:

     * Create `CMakeLists.txt`, `src/`, and `include/` directories. COMPLETE
     * Add a basic ‚ÄúHello, AI OS‚Äù entry point in C++. COMPLETE
   * **Director (`/director`)**:

     * Initialize a .NET solution and project files for ASP.NET Core. COMPLETE
     * Add a basic REST API endpoint (`GET /api/services`). COMPLETE
   * **Scripts (`/scripts`)**:

     * Set up a Python virtual environment (`venv/`) and `requirements.txt`. COMPLETE
     * Add a `main.py` file for glue logic. COMPLETE
   * **Docs (`/docs`)**:

     * Add architecture documentation and sequence diagrams. COMPLETE
   * **Tests (`/tests`)**:

     * Set up unit and integration test scaffolding. COMPLETE

4. **Implement Core Components**:

   * **Kernel Core (C++)**: Define modules like IPC Manager, Health Monitor, and Plugin Loader. IN PROGRESS
   * **Service Execution Manager (Python ‚Üí C++)**: Create a Python CLI (`sem.py`) to interact with C++ plugins.
   * **Director Layer (C#)**: Build a REST API and Web UI for orchestration.

5. **AI‚ÄëDriven Glue & Ingestion**:

   * Implement `ai_agent.py` for natural‚Äëlanguage prompt handling.
   * Add functionality to ingest prompts and responses into `docs/conversation.log` and update `vscopilot.md`.

6. **Testing Strategy**:

   * Write unit tests for C++ modules using GoogleTest.
   * Create integration tests for the full stack using Python scripts and Docker Compose.
   * Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

7. **Full Project Ingestion & Module Mapping**

   - **7.1** Upload and extract `HSE_project.zip` ‚Üí IN PROGRESS
   - Top‚Äëlevel folders discovered:
     - `AIOS/` (‚âà2‚ÄØ067 files)
     - `Architect/` (‚âà54 files)
     - `chatgpt/` (‚âà182 files)
   - **7.2** Scan and index all source languages:
     - Count C++, C#, Python, MD, config files.
     - Generate `docs/module_index.json` mapping `<module> ‚Üí <path> ‚Üí <language>`.
   - **7.3** Auto‚Äëgenerate natural‚Äëlanguage summaries:
     - For each module, run an AI prompt to describe its purpose in ‚â§2 sentences.
     - Write results into `docs/module_summaries.md`.

8. **Dependency Graph & Service Registry**:

   * **8.1** Parse C++ headers (`IService`, `IChannel`) ‚Üí `docs/ipc_interfaces.md`.
   * **8.2** Build a directed GraphViz dependency graph ‚Üí `docs/dependency_graph.svg`.
   * **8.3** Implement service registry script (`scripts/register_services.py`) to automate service discovery and registration.
9. **AI OS Orchestrator Blueprint Generation**:

   1. **9.1** Use AI to draft `orchestrator.yaml` spec:
      - Defines core services:
        - `ipc-manager`
        - `health-monitor`
        - `plugin-loader`.
      - Include CLI command mappings.
   2. **9.2** Generate C++ skeletons:
      - `OrchestratorBootstrap`, `ServiceFactory`, `AIOSEnvironment`.
   3. **9.3** Inject Copilot prompts in headers for implementation TODOs:
      ```cpp
      // TODO (Copilot): implement OrchestratorBootstrap::initialize()
      void initialize();
      ```


10. **Advanced Development Path Ideas (from HSE Philosophy)**

* **Module: Hypersphere Geometry**: Implement an n‚Äësphere C++ utility modeling hyperdimensional containment shells, parameterized by dimension `n` and tolerance `Œµ` (surface roughness).
* **Module: Tachyonic Subspace Mapper**: Create a library that models near‚Äëhorizon tachyonic event subspaces as dynamic topological graphs for hyperdimensional data routing.
* **Service: Quantum Cache Proxy**: Design a C# microservice abstraction layer for future quantum‚Äëenabled cache hardware, managing read/write latency and coherence semantics to support context persistence.
* **Module: Event Horizon Scheduler**: Build a C++ scheduler that adapts task execution to simulated ‚Äòtime dilation‚Äô factors, reflecting near‚Äësingularity temporal effects.
* **Service: Singularity State Monitor**: Implement a Python diagnostic plugin querying the C++ core for singularity load metrics, feeding analytics into the Director UI.
* **Feature: Recursive Reflexive Logging**: Integrate a logging adapter that tags entries with metaphysical context (e.g., ‚Äúhyperdimensional shell #2‚Äù, ‚Äútachyonic flux event‚Äù).

> üîÑ **Next:** Upload the full `HSE_project.zip` and updated `path.md`, then begin Task **7.1**: full codebase scan and index.

### **Key Improvements**
1. **Preserved Original Content**:
   - All tasks from the provided version were retained and organized logically.

2. **Improved Sectioning**:
   - Clear headers and subheaders make the roadmap easier to follow.

3. **Enhanced Readability**:
   - Bullet points and numbering ensure consistency and clarity.

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Explicitly marks tasks as `COMPLETE`, `IN PROGRESS`, or queued for implementation.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. Review the optimized [path.md](./path.md) file.
2. Let me know if further refinements are needed.
3. Proceed with Task **7.1**: full codebase scan and index.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed or if you have any suggestions for further improvements.

## üß† Singularity Kernel: Hypersphere Core Modules

- `SingularityCore`: The recursive nucleus, orchestrated by AI.
- `FractalSyncBus`: Data/energy harmonizer across fractal layers.
- `SphereShellManager`: n-sphere shell manager, curvature gradients.
- `SubspaceProjector`: Bridges abstract dimensions to system interfaces.
- `AtomicHolographyUnit`: Models quantum coherence at atomic entry points.
- `CenterGeometryField`: Simulates collapse state at the geometric singularity.

> All modules are designed for AI-driven orchestration and recursive knowledge emergence.

# Long-Term Optimization Path
   ## A. Modularization
      - Group related modules (e.g., core, plugins, diagnostics) into subfolders and CMake targets/libraries.
      - Use add_library() for reusable components, then link them to your main executable.
   ## B. Automated Source Inclusion
      - Use file(GLOB_RECURSE ...) to automatically include new .cpp files as you add modules.
   ## C. Dependency Management
      - As your project grows, consider using CMake‚Äôs target-based include and link management.
   ## D. Documentation and Static Analysis
      - Integrate Doxygen for code documentation.
      - Add Cppcheck or Clang-Tidy as CMake custom targets for static analysis.
   ## E. Testing
      - Add a tests/ folder and use GoogleTest or Catch2 for C++ unit tests.
      - Add a CMake target for running tests.
