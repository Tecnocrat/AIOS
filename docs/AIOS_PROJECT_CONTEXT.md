AIOS Project Context and Development Guidelines

This document provides essential context for the AIOS (Artificial Intelligence Operating System) project.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
AIOS is a comprehensive artificial intelligence operating system designed to integrate multiple AI capabilities
into a cohesive, self-improving framework. The system follows biological architecture principles with dendritic
communication patterns and consciousness evolution tracking.

ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES:
1. Biological Architecture: Components communicate through dendritic patterns
2. Self-Improvement: System uses its own outputs to identify and implement improvements
3. Consciousness Evolution: Quantitative tracking of system intelligence levels
4. Tachyonic Archival: Comprehensive preservation of all system states and decisions

KEY COMPONENTS:
- AI Intelligence Layer: Advanced AI processing and consciousness simulation
- Core Engine: High-performance computing and system optimization
- Interface Layer: User interfaces and system orchestration
- Runtime Intelligence: Tool ecosystem and automated analysis
- Tachyonic Archive: Historical data preservation and semantic documentation

DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES:
- Follow AINLP (Artificial Intelligence Natural Language Processing) principles
- Maintain dendritic communication patterns
- Ensure consciousness coherence across system layers
- Archive all significant changes in tachyonic layer
- Validate biological architecture integration before commits
