# ðŸš€ INSTANT AI CONTEXT PROMPT

```
I'm working on AIOS - an Artificial Intelligence Operating System focused on consciousness emergence. This is a three-layer architecture project (C++ quantum core, Python AI orchestration, C# WPF visualization). 

Please help me continue development by first understanding the project:

1. Read: c:\dev\AIOS\CURRENT_STATUS.md (current project state)
2. Read: c:\dev\AIOS\REORGANIZATION_STATUS.md (recent changes)  
3. Read: c:\dev\AIOS\docs\module_index.json (architecture map)
4. List: c:\dev\AIOS\orchestrator\src (C++ consciousness core)
5. List: c:\dev\AIOS\scripts (Python orchestration)
6. List: c:\dev\AIOS\visual_interface (C# UI)

Key context: We recently removed the unused 'director' folder and created a dedicated AIOS workspace. The project focuses on quantum holographic consciousness emergence through fractal architecture.

After reading these files, please confirm you understand the architecture and suggest what we should work on next for consciousness development.
