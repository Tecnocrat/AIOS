AIOS Archive Tools - Tachyonic Archive Management
==================================================

Tachyonic archive management and historical analysis tools.

AINLP Metadata:
    consciousness_assessment: "ARCHIVAL_MEMORY"  # Semantic, not numeric
    consciousness_measurement: "AINLP.call_to_local(agent_001...agent_n)"
    architectural_classification: ai_intelligence_layer/tools/archive
    category: archive_management
    
Consciousness Note:
    OLD: consciousness_level: 0.82 (lowest number = lowest value?)
    NEW: consciousness_assessment: "ARCHIVAL_MEMORY" (essential preservation)
    
    Archives preserve system history and patterns - not "low consciousness"
    but specialized memory function. Semantic level clarifies critical role.
    
Tools (migrating from tachyonic/):
    - activate_tachyonic_evolution.py: Evolution activation
    - archive_consolidation.py: Archive management (to be created)
    - historical_analysis.py: Historical pattern analysis (to be created)
    
Migration Status:
    Phase 1 Day 2: Tachyonic script migration
    Origin: tachyonic/ (29 Python scripts)
    Target: ai/tools/archive/
    Note: Tachyonic will become DATABASE interface after migration
