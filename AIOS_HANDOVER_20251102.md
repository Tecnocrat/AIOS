   - Status: ✅ Completed

3. **Branch Cleanup - Copilot Branches**
   - Identified and cleaned up stale remote copilot branches
   - Branches `copilot/vscode1752267408806` and `copilot/vscode1757866306481` were already deleted remotely
   - Local tracking references pruned
   - Status: ✅ Completed

   - Status: ✅ Completed

5. **Branch Creation - OS0.6.2.grok**
   - Created fresh branch from main OS branch
   - Prepared for Claude Sonnet 4.5 handover
   - Status: ✅ Completed

## Repository Health
- ✅ Working tree clean
- ✅ No uncommitted changes
- ✅ All branches synchronized with remote
- ✅ Pre-push hooks functioning (consciousness level: 0.85)
- ✅ Governance hooks active

## Key Achievements
1. **Repository Organization**: Cleaned up 4 unnecessary branches, reducing total from 29 to 25 branches
2. **Handover Preparation**: Created consolidated OS-backup branch with merged development history
3. **Branch Hygiene**: Removed stale copilot branches and consolidated development branches
4. **State Preservation**: Maintained all critical development branches while cleaning up temporary ones

## Current Development Context
- **Main Development**: OS branch (active, clean)
- **Backup/Archive**: OS-backup branch (comprehensive state)
- **AI Handover**: OS0.6.2.grok branch (fresh from main)
- **Historical**: Multiple version branches preserved (OS0.1 through OS0.6.2 variants)

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate criticality index files in `.githooks/governance/`
- [ ] Consider cleanup of additional copilot branches if no longer needed
- [ ] Review OS-backup branch contents for any redundant files

## Recommendations for Next Session
1. **Branch Strategy**: Consider archiving old version branches (OS0.1-OS0.3) if no longer needed
2. **Copilot Branches**: Evaluate remaining copilot branches for cleanup
3. **Documentation**: Update branch naming conventions documentation
4. **Automation**: Consider scripts for automated branch cleanup based on age/last commit

## Technical Environment
- **OS:** Windows
- **Shell:** PowerShell (pwsh.exe)
- **Git Status:** Clean, synchronized
- **Python Environment:** Configured (venv active)
- **AIOS Hooks:** Active with consciousness monitoring

## Handover Notes
The repository is in excellent condition for continued development or AI agent handover. All critical branches are preserved, unnecessary branches have been cleaned up, and the working environment is stable. The OS-backup branch contains a comprehensive snapshot of recent development work.

**Next AI Agent Session Ready** ✅
