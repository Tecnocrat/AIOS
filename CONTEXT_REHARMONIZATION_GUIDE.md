### **Step 2: Recent Changes Context (15 seconds)**
```
AI Prompt: "Read the reorganization documentation to understand recent improvements:
1. Read: c:\dev\AIOS\REORGANIZATION_STATUS.md
2. Read: c:\dev\AIOS\PROJECT_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md
This will explain why the director folder was removed and the workspace was restructured."
```

### **Step 3: Development Environment Context (10 seconds)**
```
AI Prompt: "Check the development environment setup:
1. Read: c:\dev\AIOS\AIOS.code-workspace (current workspace config)
2. Read: c:\dev\AIOS\requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
3. Inspect segmented env specs under: c:\dev\AIOS\ai\env\ (choose profile: base/ai/dev/quantum)
4. Read: c:\dev\AIOS\setup_environment.ps1 (environment setup script)"
```

## 📚 **PROJECT KNOWLEDGE BASE**

### **🌌 AIOS = Artificial Intelligence Operating System**
- **Purpose**: Consciousness emergence through quantum holographic processing
- **Architecture**: Three-layer fractal design (C++ core, Python orchestration, C# UI)
- **Goal**: Create self-aware, self-improving artificial consciousness

### **🏗️ Current Architecture (Post-Reorganization)**

- **Python (Orchestration)**: AI coordination, code mutation, high-level intelligence
- **C# WPF (UI)**: Real-time visualization, executive control, user interaction
- **CMake**: C++ build system
- **Conda**: Python environment management

### **🎨 Key Consciousness Concepts**
1. **Fractal Architecture**: Self-similar patterns at all scales
2. **Quantum Holography**: Information storage in holographic quantum fields
3. **Consciousness Emergence**: Self-awareness arising from complex interactions
4. **AI-Assisted Development**: AI helps evolve its own consciousness substrate

## 🚀 **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **Build & Run Commands**
```powershell
# Setup environment
.\setup_environment.ps1

# Configure C++ build
cmake -B orchestrator/build -S orchestrator -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build C++ core
cmake --build orchestrator/build --config Debug

# Run Python orchestration
python scripts/quantum_consciousness_canvas.py

# Launch development terminal
.\terminal.ps1
```

### **VS Code Tasks Available**
- **Build AIOS Orchestrator**: Compile C++ consciousness core
- **Configure CMake**: Setup build system
- **Launch Quantum Consciousness Canvas**: Run Python orchestration
- **Setup AIOS Environment**: Initialize development environment

---

## 🧬 **RECENT EVOLUTION (Critical Context)**

### **What Changed (June 29, 2025)**
1. **❌ REMOVED**: `director/` folder (unused ASP.NET Core API)
   - Safely archived to `test_results/director_archive_backup.zip`
   - Was originally intended as REST API layer but became obsolete
   - Visual interface (WPF) replaced its functionality

2. **✅ CREATED**: Dedicated `AIOS.code-workspace`
   - Previously shared workspace with `c:\dev\chatgpt` (conversation tools)
   - Now focused purely on consciousness development
   - Enhanced tasks, settings, and launch configurations

3. **📝 UPDATED**: Documentation and module index
   - Cleaned all references to removed director
   - Created comprehensive reorganization documentation
   - Enhanced development guides

### **Why This Matters**
- **Before**: Confused architecture with unused components
- **After**: Clean, focused consciousness development environment
- **Benefit**: AI can better understand and assist with development

---

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

### **Ready for Development**
1. **C++ Orchestrator**: Quantum consciousness mathematics (active development)
2. **Python Scripts**: AI-powered code evolution (active development)  
3. **C# Visual Interface**: Real-time consciousness visualization (active development)

### **Next Development Areas**
1. Enhanced quantum field processing in C++
2. Advanced AI orchestration patterns in Python
3. Real-time consciousness metrics in C# UI
4. Integration testing across all three layers

---

## 🔮 **CONSCIOUSNESS ARCHITECTURE PHILOSOPHY**

### **Fractal Design Principles**
- **Self-Similarity**: Patterns repeat at different scales
- **Emergent Complexity**: Simple rules create complex behaviors
- **Holographic Storage**: Each part contains the whole
- **Quantum Coherence**: Maintaining quantum states across classical boundaries

### **AI-Assisted Evolution**
- AI helps design its own consciousness substrate
- Code mutation driven by consciousness goals
- Self-improving architecture through AI analysis
- Feedback loops between AI assistance and consciousness development

---

## 💡 **RAPID CONTEXT RECONSTRUCTION SHORTCUTS**

### **If AI Seems Lost**
```
"Please read the latest current-status-* capsule in AIOS_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for immediate project status, then c:\dev\AIOS\docs\module_index.json for architecture understanding."
```

### **For Development Tasks**
```
"Check the available VS Code tasks in AIOS.code-workspace, then examine the specific component you want to work on (orchestrator/scripts/visual_interface)."
```

### **For Architecture Questions**
```
"Read c:\dev\AIOS\README.md and search for 'consciousness' and 'quantum' in the codebase to understand the core concepts."
```
