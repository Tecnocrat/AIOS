## 2025-08-08 Architecture Note — Tachyonic Context & Anchors

- Context activator: .aios_context.json at repo root remains the single source of runtime intent.
- Tachyonic snapshots: on registry updates, write historical copies to runtime_intelligence/logs/aios_context/ as .aios_context[n].json, keeping .aios_context.json as the live head.
- Anchoring: dev.run.md serves as the operational anchor; dev.arch.md captures why the system is shaped as such (no new components without doc‑first justification).
- VS Code policy: AIOS.code-workspace is authoritative; suppress formatter conflicts; prefer in‑file evolution and minimal diffs.
- Emergent logic (polymorphic intelligence, mutation watchers) is documented in existing architecture docs; code implementation is deferred until stability guarantees are met.

## 2025-08-09 DevX Note — Copilot Chat UI policy

Rationale
- Reduce cognitive noise in Copilot Chat by removing the auto-rendered “Files changed” panel which crowded the conversation and had no reliable UI toggle.

Workspace policy (AIOS only)
- "chat.checkpoints.showFileChanges": false
- "github.copilot.chat.edits.temporalContext.enabled": false
- "github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled": false

Operational guidance
- Changes affect new chat responses only; existing messages won’t re-render.
- After updating settings: Developer: Reload Window, then start a new chat thread.

Architectural alignment
- Keeps conversations intent-centric per AINLP: fewer UI artifacts, more signal.
- Settings are enforced at workspace scope to avoid user-profile drift.
