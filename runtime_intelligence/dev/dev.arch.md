## 2025-08-08 Architecture Note — Tachyonic Context & Anchors

- Context activator: .aios_context.json at repo root remains the single source of runtime intent.
- Tachyonic snapshots: on registry updates, write historical copies to runtime_intelligence/logs/aios_context/ as .aios_context[n].json, keeping .aios_context.json as the live head.
- Anchoring: dev.run.md serves as the operational anchor; dev.arch.md captures why the system is shaped as such (no new components without doc‑first justification).
- VS Code policy: AIOS.code-workspace is authoritative; suppress formatter conflicts; prefer in‑file evolution and minimal diffs.
- Emergent logic (polymorphic intelligence, mutation watchers) is documented in existing architecture docs; code implementation is deferred until stability guarantees are met.
