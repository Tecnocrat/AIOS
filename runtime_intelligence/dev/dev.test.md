# AIOS Testing Strategy - Runtime Intelligence Validation

## ⚓ Tachyonic anchor/reset & coherence gates (distilled)
- Anchor: record testing milestones and approvals in `dev.run.md`.
- Reset: context snapshots (`.aios_context*.json`) are written only to `runtime_intelligence/logs/aios_context/`.
- Stability: consistent interpreter/env; suppress formatter prompts; avoid root-level file creation; keep tests under `ai/tests/`.
- Guardrails: when tests reflect path/API changes, update tachyonic changelog and docs; use atomic writes for registry.
- Coherence gates: apply AINL LFC/GPC quick score; if <0.4, run discovery (perimeter search, module README/spec, tests) before edits. See `docs/tachyonic/AIOS.Harmonizer.AINL.md`.

## 🎯 **Testing Philosophy: Continuous Validation Excellence**

### **Core Testing Strategy: Fractal Validation Patterns**
The AIOS testing approach leverages **fractal intelligence patterns** to ensure continuous system health through the massive refactorization and beyond. Our testing philosophy is built on three critical pillars:

1. **Pattern Validation**: Fractal consistency testing across all subsystems
2. **Performance Verification**: Continuous optimization measurement and validation
3. **Regression Prevention**: Zero-tolerance policy for functionality degradation

**Testing Success Metrics (Post-Refactorization):**
- Integration Tests: 8/8 passing (100% success rate)
- Error Resolution: 88+ critical errors → 0 (100% elimination)
- Performance Validation: 63.06ms → 0.0ms cached operations verified
- Type Safety: 100% Pylance compliance maintained through transformation
