---

## Logging, Diagnostics, and Archival Pattern

- **Logger (`src/Logger.hpp`):**
  - Always uses the next available sequential filename for logs (`kernel_0.log`, `kernel_1.log`, ...).
  - All log entries are timestamped and categorized (`[INFO]`, `[META]`, etc.).
  - Designed for AI ingestion: logs are structured, consistent, and easy to parse.
- **Diagnostics:**
  - Each run generates a new `diagnostics_N.json` file, capturing system state at both start and finish.
  - Diagnostics include entropy, curvature, health status, and any other relevant runtime metrics.
- **Archive Directory:**
  - All logs and diagnostics are stored in `orchestrator/archive/`.
  - No files are overwritten; every run is preserved for future analysis and AI-driven refactoring.
- **Module Index & Summaries:**
  - [`docs/module_index.json`](docs/module_index.json) provides a machine- and human-readable mapping of all modules, their paths, and languages.
  - [`docs/summary/module_summaries.md`](docs/summary/module_summaries.md) contains concise, human/AI-readable summaries for each module.

---

## AI Ingestion & Meta-Analysis

- **All conversational context, code changes, and design decisions are archived in Markdown and multi-format logs.**
- **The system is designed for recursive ingestion:**  
  - Each iteration can be re-ingested by future AI engines, enabling resonance-cascade-aware refactoring and knowledge harmonization.
- **Meta-data files (logs, diagnostics, module index, summaries) are the foundation for future AI-driven orchestration, debugging, and self-improvement.**
- **Natural-language attractor comments and TODOs in code act as prompts for LLMs and Copilot to generate, refactor, and extend the system.**

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Every kernel run creates new, uniquely numbered log and diagnostics files.**
2. **All modules are initialized and their state is logged and archived.**
3. **Interactive CLI UI allows runtime inspection of diagnostics, log paths, and health status.**
4. **All code, logs, and diagnostics are designed for both human and AI readability and ingestion.**
5. **All major changes, conversations, and iterations are archived in Markdown for recursive context.**
6. **Module index and summaries are auto-generated for future automation and AI-driven documentation.**
7. **Tachyonic backups of meta files are created for every major update.**

---

## Next Steps & Future Vision

- **Continue recursive ingestion and meta-data harmonization using `aios_admin.py`.**
- **Proceed with dependency graph and service registry automation.**
- **Integrate Doxygen and static analysis for C++ codebase.**
- **Expand Director Layer for orchestration and UI.**
- **Automate full codebase and conversational ingestion for continuous context harmonization.**
- **Implement advanced semantic indexing and meta-data management for AI-driven refactoring and knowledge evolution.**

---

## Final Notes

- **All code, documentation, and process flows are designed for recursive, AI-driven evolution.**
- **The archive is the tachyonic database—every log and diagnostic is a resonance in the project's spacetime.**
- **You are building not just software, but a recursive cognition system—a living, evolving AI-powered ecosystem.**

---

## Recursive Orchestration & Meta-Archive Protocol

- **Meta Archive Protocol:**  
  - All meta files (`path.md`, `README.md`, `module_index.json`, `dependency_graph.dot`, `dependency_graph.svg`, `services_registry.json`, logs) are archived under `/archive/meta/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/` before each major operation.
  - Ensures no context or meta-data is ever lost; every iteration is available for future AI/human ingestion.

- **Automated Dependency Graph & Service Registry:**  
  - `/scripts/aios_indexer.py` scans all source files for service patterns and dependencies.
  - Outputs `docs/dependency_graph.dot`, `.svg`, and `docs/services_registry.json`.
  - Enables recursive orchestration, self-reflection, and dynamic service mutation.

- **Natural Language Expansion:**  
  - New modules and features can be requested in natural language.
  - The system proposes names, summaries, and stubs, auto-injects them into the registry and dependency graph, and archives all changes.

- **Recursive Dev Cycle:**  
  - After each commit or major update:
    - Run `aios_indexer.py`
    - Archive outputs and meta files
    - Re-ingest into AI for harmonized feedback and further evolution

---

### Service Execution Manager (SEM) Integration

- The Python SEM (`scripts/sem.py`) invokes the main kernel executable with a JSON command as an argument.
- The kernel parses the command and executes the requested action, returning a JSON result.
- No new plugin files are created; all orchestration is handled by the existing kernel and modules.

| Layer         | Integration Point                | File(s) to Update                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Python        | SEM CLI logic                    | `scripts/sem.py`                    |
| C++           | JSON command handler             | `orchestrator/src/PluginLoader.cpp` |
| Documentation | Usage and protocol               | `README.md`, `docs/path.md`         |
---

*You may now describe new modules, features, or abstractions in natural language. The system will recursively expand, document, and archive itself, ensuring perpetual harmonization and growth.*

### **🛡️ Private Use Configuration**
```powershell
# Automated Private Setup (Recommended)
cd "c:\dev\AIOS\vscode-extension"
.\setup-private.ps1 -All

# Manual Private Setup
# 1. VSCode → F1 → "Developer: Install Extension from Location..."
# 2. Select: c:\dev\AIOS\vscode-extension\aios-vscode-0.4.0.vsix
# 3. Configure private settings (see PRIVATE_USE_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md)
```

### **🔐 Private Use Features**
- **🔒 Local Only**: No external connections or data sharing

- **🛠️ Developer Tools**: Rich command palette and status monitoring

### **Usage**
```typescript
// In any VSCode chat window:
@aios Help me understand this code
@aios /status           // Show AIOS system status
@aios /reset            // Reset conversation context
@aios /save             // Save current context (IMPLEMENTED)
@aios /help             // Show all commands
```

### **Privacy & Security**
- ✅ **No External Connections**: All processing happens locally
- ✅ **No Telemetry**: All analytics and tracking disabled
- ✅ **Encrypted Context**: Local context storage with encryption
- ✅ **Session-Only Logs**: Minimal logging with automatic cleanup
