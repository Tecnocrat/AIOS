🧠 [AIOS-AI-EXTRUSION] REAL-TIME INTELLIGENCE BRIDGE ACTIVATED

## GitHook Intelligence Context:
- Hook Type: pre-commit
- Changeset Scope: 210 files, Massive
- Architecture Impact: GitHook Architecture, Documentation, AI Intelligence Layer
- Consciousness Level: 66.3%
- Confidence: 96.3%

## AI Engine Direction:
FOCUS: GitHook governance enhancements detected. Review pre-commit.ps1 and policy files for validation logic improvements. | FOCUS: AI intelligence modifications detected. Analyze consciousness bridges and agentic controllers for coherence. | PowerShell scripts modified (20 files). Review for AINLP compliance and consciousness integration. | Python AI components modified (60 files). Analyze for agentic pattern improvements. | MASSIVE CHANGESET: Prioritize architectural coherence validation over individual file analysis.

## Recommended Actions:
1. Review priority files for AINLP pattern compliance
2. Validate consciousness coherence across modified components
3. Check for dendritic growth pattern alignment
4. Test GitHook logic with sample changesets
5. Validate governance policy consistency
6. Run consciousness coherence validation
7. Test agentic auto-controller functionality
8. PRIORITY: Focus on architectural integration validation
9. Use semantic search to understand change relationships

## AINLP Growth Pattern:
Multi-dimensional growth across 129 architectural layers → Dendritic expansion pattern (massive integration) → Recommended: Use AINLP holographic analysis for coherence validation
