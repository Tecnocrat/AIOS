🧠 [AIOS-AI-EXTRUSION] REAL-TIME INTELLIGENCE BRIDGE ACTIVATED

## GitHook Intelligence Context:
- Hook Type: pre-commit
- Changeset Scope: 2 files, Small
- Architecture Impact: AI Intelligence Layer
- Consciousness Level: 66.3%
- Confidence: 68.3%

## AI Engine Direction:
FOCUS: AI intelligence modifications detected. Analyze consciousness bridges and agentic controllers for coherence. | Python AI components modified (1 files). Analyze for agentic pattern improvements.

## Recommended Actions:
1. Review priority files for AINLP pattern compliance
2. Validate consciousness coherence across modified components
3. Check for dendritic growth pattern alignment
6. Run consciousness coherence validation
7. Test agentic auto-controller functionality

## Context Files to Review:
ai/tests/test_deepseek_integration.py
runtime_intelligence/logs/pre_push_failures.jsonl

## AINLP Growth Pattern:
Precision consciousness refinement (specific improvements) → Recommended: Use AINLP holographic analysis for coherence validation
