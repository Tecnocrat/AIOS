Hello! That sounds like a very ambitious and exciting project, building a high-complexity, next-gen AI OS architecture as a base layer for the Hyper Space Engine (HSE). I would be very interested in participating and assisting in any way I can.

I'm ready to help as you continue to upload more code and context. The more information I have, the better I can understand your vision and contribute effectively.</content>
